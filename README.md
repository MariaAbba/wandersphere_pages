This project is a modern multipage website built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Headless UI, offering a fully responsive and user-friendly interface. It leverages React for seamless page transitions and dynamic rendering, ensuring a smooth user experience. Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first, highly customizable styling, which results in a clean and responsive design. Headless UI is incorporated to provide accessible, fully customizable UI components that blend perfectly with Tailwind, creating a flexible foundation for building scalable web applications. The website also features interactive sliders and smooth animations to further enhance the user experience. With a mobile-first approach, the website is fully responsive across all screen sizes.
